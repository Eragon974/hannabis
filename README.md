Rules of Hanabi

Hanabi is a cooperative card game that is played with a deck of cards numbered 1 through 5 in five different colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and white. The goal is to play cards in ascending order for each color to create a successful fireworks display.
Main Rules:

    Limited Information:
        Players can't see their own cards; they can only see the cards held by their teammates.
        Players can provide limited information about the cards in other players' hands.

    Turns:
        On each turn, a player can choose to either play a card or give information to a teammate.
        Players have a limited number of hints available to give information about the cards.

    Fireworks Display:
        Players aim to play cards in ascending order for each color to create a successful fireworks display.
        Players lose points for mistakes, such as playing a card out of order or discarding a playable card.

    Ending the Game:
        The game ends when the players successfully complete the fireworks display or run out of time or make too many mistakes.
